This Reactjs app fetches the latest cryptocurrency rates in USD and displays them along with the rates for the last 5 days. The current rates are refreshed every 10 seconds. The rates are cached in the browser's IndexedDB for offline support. The app is a PWA and can be added to the homescreen on an Android device.
